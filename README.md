Dictionary Definition: a book of sailing directions with charts and descriptions of harbors and coasts.

Project Definition: A project for visualizing Kubernetes Helm Charts

This is personal OpenSource project that is currently **in progress**, and **very new.**

## Idea
When viewing Helm Chart's repositories or metadata I get a word description of the Helm Chart's solution. In addition to the word description, it would be nice to get a *whiteboard* view of the Helm Chart's solution. Something similar to what one would draw up on a whiteboard to explain what applications are in the solutions, and how they interact with each other (ie ports, parameters).

## User Stories
<tbd>

## Research
I have found other great projects helping to visualize a Kubernetes deployment such as (not a complete list):
- https://github.com/brendandburns/gcp-live-k8s-visualizer
- https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/node-perf-dash
- https://github.com/google/cluster-insight
- https://github.com/kubernetes-ui/graph
- https://github.com/weaveworks/scope
- https://deis.com/blog/2016/monitoring-kubernetes-with-heapster/
- https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/

[KubeApps](https://kubeapps.com) also does a great job of helping users find Helm Charts. However, most of these projects are for visualizing a running K8s cluster. I wanted to visualize the Helm Chart before deploying. Perhaps this a coming feature of [Monocular](https://github.com/kubernetes-helm/monocular).

***If you know of a project that does this please let me know :-)***
